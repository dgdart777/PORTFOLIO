          </a> &nbsp;
The first piece, a ceramic cast teacup,<i> ‘Mum wants a cup of tea’ (Fig. 4)</i>, is a tribute to the everyday moments I
share with my mother, moments that may seem fleeting but are deeply significant
to me. Each detail of this teacup <i>(Fig. 4)</i> had been carved by hand, a
process that required patience and deliberate focus — a meditative act, echoing
the essence of <i>‘Samskara’</i>. As I etched each line, I revisited scenes of
my mother at work, whether typing on the computer, preparing meals, or sharing
her thoughts during family gatherings. These actions may seem simple, but they
hold a world of meaning for me. They speak to her commitment, her care, and her
presence in my life. The scumble glaze I chose for the teacup <i>(Fig. 4.)</i> gives it an aged appearance, connecting it to the aesthetic of ancient Indian
carvings <i>(Fig. 2. And Fig. 3.)</i> and drawing a parallel between those
timeless works and the lasting impression my mother has left on me.
In a further homage to our shared time, I
filled the cup <i>(Fig. 4)</i> with used teabags from her own cups of tea. This
accumulation of used teabags is more than a nod to our shared ritual — it’s a
tangible symbol of the many small moments that add up to form the fabric of our
relationship. The amount of teabags was also symbolic, as my mother’s favourite
number was 786 – I had deliberately chosen to only use half that amount in
numbers of teabags (393 used teabags) as a reflection on myself as being ‘half’
of her worth. The teacup <i>(Fig. 4)</i>, filled in this way, represents the
fleeting but recurring nature of time and how each moment, even those that may
seem insignificant, is stored in memory, shaping who we are and how we see
those we love. The use of the ‘Western’ teacup <i>(Fig. 4.)</i> was a direct
challenge to Indian culture, as tea itself comes from Indian background, which
had been drastically changed due to colonisation.<br>

5. </b><i>(Fig. 5) ‘Mum wants a cup of tea:2’ </i>by Dheepana Gopi Devi Nirhoo. Carvings on ceramic plaques, scumble
glazed.
A Secondary piece <i>(Fig. 5)</i>, ‘<i>Mum
wants a cup of tea:2’</i> was then formed from the first artwork <i>(Fig. 4)</i>,
where I had then chosen to directly use my heritage in depicting moments of
times spent with my mother, throughout my life, in the form of ceramic cast
plaques, hand carved and bisque fired, just like the first piece (<i>Fig. 4.)</i>,
it required a lot of patience and focus to maintain adequate pressure to not
break the clay. Inspired by ancient Indian art traditions <i>(Fig. 2)</i>, I
aimed to capture these everyday memories in a tangible form, echoing the way
history was once recorded through intricate carvings and preserved stories, Thiong’o
(1994:439) mentions that language should be seen as a dual character, both as a
means of communication and a carrier of culture, I used ancient Indian
techniques (<i>Fig. 2 and Fig 3)</i> of capturing ‘culture’ by depicting
simplistic moments spent with my mother, created in a way in which it depicts a
story. &nbsp;Like Manesh Manu’s installation, <i>(Fig.
1),</i> both artworks <i>(Fig. 4. And Fig. 5. Respectively),</i> also use
details of Indian geometric patterns to convey the Indian heritage.

          <p>My third piece, ‘Stars for Mum’ (Fig. 6.) is a portrait of my mother crafted from recycled aluminium cans, folded and crimped into origami stars. The form of strips of cans was extracted from collected cans, which were washed, cut, and shredded by hand into strips, then folded and crimped in a special technique to form a true ‘star’ – the form we recognise in school. I create an entire portrait out of each of these stars, as a means of ‘awarding’ my mother with stars for all her efforts. By reusing aluminium cans — ordinary, often-discarded objects — I wanted to symbolise how my mother brings light and value to what others might overlook. Each star represents an act of love or pride, a gift I give back to her in recognition of all she has done. Up close (Fig. 6), viewers can see the individuality of each star, just as one might notice each unique quality of my mother. But from afar (Fig. 6), these stars combine to form her portrait, a vision of her radiant, complex presence that brightens my world.</p>
          <p>The stars (Fig. 6) form a rainbow, which for me is a representation of my mother as a “ray of sunshine,” illuminating the lives of everyone around her. The rainbow signifies joy, strength, and vibrancy —qualities I see in her, even if they are subtle, even if they are sometimes unrecognised. In making this portrait (Fig. 6.), I aimed to show how each small act — each folded star, each gesture — comes together to form the broader image of my mother as I see her: a source of light, warmth, and inspiration.</p>
          <p>As Vivan Sundram (2015:25) mentions that artistic expression, rooted in cultural heritage, has the potential to create powerful connections and foster a deeper understanding of shared human experiences, by reflecting on ‘Samskara’, I have learned to see my mother through a lens that highlights the significance of every small action, every word spoken, and every look shared. Through these two pieces, I hope to convey how much I admire her hard work, her resilience, and her grace. This work was my way of documenting, preserving, and paying tribute to the beauty I see in her, one that was both profound and enduring.</p>
